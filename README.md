6.International Pricing Strategies: Understand the impact of currency exchange rates on sales and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.

Approach
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handle missing values.
Convert data types where necessary (e.g., date formats, numerical values).
Merge datasets (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
2. Load Data
Insert preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating tables for each dataset.
Use SQL INSERT statements to load the data.
3. Power BI/Tableau Visualization
Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau.
Import the cleaned data and build interactive dashboards to visualize insights.
4. Develop SQL Queries
Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights that address business questions.

Analysis Steps
Customer Analysis
Demographic Distribution: Analyze customers by gender, age (calculated from birthday), location (city, state, country, continent).
Purchase Patterns: Identify purchasing patterns such as average order value, frequency of purchases, and preferred products.
Segmentation: Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.
Sales Analysis
Overall Sales Performance: Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality.
Sales by Product: Evaluate which products are top performers based on quantity sold and revenue.
Sales by Store: Assess store performance by comparing sales data.
Sales by Currency: Examine the impact of currency exchange rates on sales.
Product Analysis
Product Popularity: Identify the most and least popular products based on sales data.
Profitability Analysis: Calculate profit margins by comparing unit cost and unit price.
Category Analysis: Analyze sales performance across different product categories and subcategories.
Store Analysis
Store Performance: Evaluate store performance based on sales, size, and operational data.
Geographical Analysis: Assess sales by store location to identify high-performing regions.
